# DeepOCR
A Python app that uses Deepseek API to improve OCR

This Python script builds on Tesseract to OCR image files and it uses the Deepseek API to correct mistakes coming from imperfect OCR-ization. The web interface builds on Gradio.

The languages for OCR are currently Serbia, Croatian, Greek, and Romanian, but that can easily be tuned in the script. The same goes for the languages of translation, which are currently English and French.
